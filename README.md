## about

I designed and created this app as part of my Computer Science A Level course.

This app allows users to create and sign into an account where they can search for and add movie/show titles into different lists, such as 'Completed', 'Planning' and 'Currently Watching'.They can also leave a rating and edit/delete these listings at any time.

## installation

- clone this repo to your local device
- in the terminal, cd into the repo directory
- run ```py myApp.py``` / ```python myApp.py``` / ```python3 myApp.py``` depending on your machine

## usage

- create an account by entering a username and password + click submit
- click the 'log a title' button at the top to search for and add a title
- select a title from the results and click 'log into profile'
- from here, you can select the amount of episodes watched, your rating and the list to save it into on your profile
- click 'save' and 'back to profile' to see the new listing
- to edit or delete an existing listing, click the title button

## issues
- there are a limited amount of titles available and the lack of images makes it difficult to differ between titles with the same name
- the 'genres' and 'years released' button functions were not completed because of time restraints
- scrollbar in the search results does not function correctly
